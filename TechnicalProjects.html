<p style="width:85vw; padding: 2.5vw;">
First, a consumer survey was done to understand the preferences and customer perception of the brand. It recorded answers to questions such as factors considered most important while purchasing a garment, brand preference, preferred price segment for each category, reasons for dissatisfaction with a garment and so on.
<br><br>
Second, each brand was studied in depth by analyzing its history, mission, STP (segmentation, targeting and positioning), 4P's of marketing (product, price, promotion and place) and a SWOT analysis.
<br><br>
Third, a comparative analysis was performed for the t-shirt product category for the SS20 collection to understand the process. The category was divided into various sub-categories such as round neck, polo neck, henley and so on. Then, the product offerings of all 8 competitors were compared based on price point and design and recommendations were given based on the gaps found in terms of prints, designs, necklines etc.
<br><br>
After comprehending the process of trend analysis, it was understood that, with fast fashion gaining popularity, brands bring in new collections almost every week and the data through which trend analysis is performed becomes redundant in a few days. In order to do resolve this issue, a software was developed to perform trend analysis with the latest data. In order to create a dynamic website, the back end of the website was powered by python and the front-end through HTML, CSS and Java Script.
<br><br>
The software extracts information of the latest product offerings from e-commerce websites, sorts the data based on product category, combines the data to create matrices, plots graphs, analyzes and draws inferences based on the information and displays an up to date competitor analysis on the website.
<br><br> 
The website refreshes data <b>automatically every day</b>, performs competitor analysis and displays the inferences generated intelligently by the software.

<h2 class="topic">Problem Statement</h2>
<em></em>    
<p style="width:85vw; padding-top: 20px;">
Standing to work has long known to be problematic as it increases risk of varicose veins, muscle fatigue and induces slouching. However, numerous jobs such as retail staff, assembly line workers, hair stylists and so on require prolonged standing.<br>
When standing, gravity pulls the blood downwards to the lower part of the body. Body mechanisms, such as valves of the veins, assist in pumping blood upwards. As blood is pumped through the body, the valves within the veins prevent the blood from flowing backwards. After extensive, prolonged standing, these valves can become weak and eventually fail. When this happens, blood is no longer being prevented from flowing backward. Gravity will pull the blood back into an individuals legs, ankles and feet. This forces the veins to expand to accommodate this extra blood.<br>
Further, muscles kept in a constant stress position quickly become
exhausted and can result in pain and swelling in the lower back, legs, ankles and feet.
</p>
    
<h2 class="topic">Solution</h2>
<em></em>    
<p style="width:85vw; padding-top: 20px;">
Anti-fatigue mats are often used to decrease foot and lower limb disorders for workers who stand in one position for long periods.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Shifting weight</b> from foot to foot provides a relief mechanism for the
operator.</li><br>  
<li><b>Balance bar</b>, the protruding half-cylinder tube at the end of the mat promotes body adjustments for balance allowing operators to change positions while standing which helps relieve stress from the body. It also alleviates muscle tension.</li><br>
<li><b>Power wedge</b>, the roller with pressure peaks at the rear end of the mat triggers nerve in the feet through a gentle massage, thereby ensuring regular proprioceptor stimulation.</li><br>
<li><b>Massage mounds</b> fixed at the sides provide arch relief and help improve blood circulation.</li><br>
<li><b>Gel packs</b> at the rear corners helps stimulate blood circulation.</li><br>
<li><b>Acupressure area</b> aids in releasing endorphins which act as natural painkillers, lowers blood pressure and helps in muscle relaxation.</li><br>
<li><b>Foam</b> at the base of the mat provides a soft yet supportive surface to the operator, encourages the body to naturally and imperceptibly sway, encouraging subtle movement of calf muscles.</li>

    <h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px; width: 85vw">Introduction<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc" style="width: 85vw">
    The project was implemented in a mass customization unit of Joseph Abboud. and Charles Tyrwhitt.<br><br>
    The CAD department at the production unit downloads a tracksheet which contains the measurements and style details of each order. After generating the marker, these sheets are sent to the substore. <br><br>
    The operators at the substore cut the required amount of fabric as mentioned on the tracksheet and add the fabric into a basket that is passed on to the cutting section.<br><br>
    The cutting machine operators open the marker by scanning the tracksheet, cut the fabric and bundle the pieces which are then passed to the fusing machnine where the shell fabric is fused.<br><br>
    Then the bundle is sent to the ready cutting table for cutting the block cut parts of garments with checked shell fabric. The pattern is obtained from the pattern table and then the operator matches the checks and cuts the parts. <br><br>
    Next, pocketing fabric, chest canvas, sleeve heads and shoulder pads are added to the bundles and passed on to quality check. The quality checker scans the tracksheet to open the marker which is projected on their tables. They check the face side, fabric code, checks matching and measurements and style by superimposing the panels with the projection. <br><br>
    In case a defect is found the bundle is sent for recutting or else the bundle is loaded into the sewing line.

    The factory recieved 700 orders per day, however, there was a bottleneck in the cutting department whose output was stagnent at around 400 purchase orders per day. This created a backlog and resulted in delay while shipping orders.

    <h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Problem<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc2">Workstations were present after every section to scan orders in order to update their location, however, manually scanning every bundle not only required manpower but was also subject to errors. As a result, bundles would get misplaced and in order to ship orders on time they would be re-processed.</p><h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Solution<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc2">Tracking sheets of individual garment would be scanned at the cutting machines and numerous quality checkpoints in order to open the marker. To improve the traceability of purchase orders, this prior process of scanning tracking sheets at various locations was integrated with the order tracking system. <br><br>
    First, a python application was created and installed on every cutting machine and quality checking table. This application would detect every purchase order number inputted on the computer in order to open the marker (no additional scanning was required) and update the order’s location along with the time and date into an excel file on the centralized network. In this way, real time production reports were produced. <br>
<center><img src="Cutting/report.png" class="img2" style=" padding: 2vh; position: relative;"></center>      
    For instance, as seen in the video below, the quality checker enters the purchase order number of the garment in order to open the marker. The program uses this entry to record the garment location. At the same time, a pop-up asks the user whether the previous garment passed quality check and stores the answer.<br><br>
<video width="80%" controls style="display: block;margin: 0 auto;">
  <source src="Cutting/application.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video><br><br>
    Second, an interface was developed through which the user could enter the purchase order number of the garment which had to be located and the program would output the latest location of the order, that is, the workstation where the tracking sheet was last scanned. The supervisors were trained on how to use the program.<br>

    b. Cutting machine operators had to get fusing from the sub-store which involved unnecessary movement
</p>
    <h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Solution<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc2">
a. Previously both the shell fabric and lining fabric were cut and kept in trays to feed to the cutting department. To ensure continuous feed, the shell fabric was fed to the cutting department in roll form itself when more than 10 purchase orders had the same shell fabric. 
<br><br>
b. Previously, operators would cut the knee lining fabric from the fabric roll. Instead, knee lining fabric was cut in bulk; operators would only have to pick and put the pre-cut fabric in the tray.
<br><br>
c. Fusing was added to the tray provided from the sub-store.
<br><br>
d. Formerly, operators had to match the code written on each fabric roll with the fabric code on the tracksheet. Later, each fabric roll was given an alphanumeric code and this code was written on board which allowed the operators to identify required rolls faster.

In order to match the checks and prevent the layers from moving, the operators would staple the fabric onto the bed. Later, these pins would break the knife and cause rash cutting.
4 blades costing Rs.750 each were damaged each day
Each blade change required 20 minutes.
Each knife break was a potential hazard

</p>
    <h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Solution<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc2">The magnetic property of the pins was used in order to remove all the pins from the bed before laying the next fabric. A powerful magnet provided to the machine operators who were trained to pick up all the pins from the bed using the magnet by just moving it across the bed once.

    <p class="desc">The process of cutting collar and collar stand of checks garments manually was a very tedious process, the paper pattern had to be procured and cut using the rotary knife.
</p><img src=""> 
    <h2 class="topic" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Solution<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc">The collar and collar stand were cut on the cutting machine by aligning the checks with the projection of patterns on the machine bed. This increased the output from 10 pieces per hour to 40 pieces per hour and reduced the man power requirement.

</p>
    <h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Solution<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc2">To solve this problem, a rack and conveyor set up was added in front of the fusing machine.<br>
• Conveyor: A longer conveyor was added in front of the fusing machine, so that operators could directly put the pieces onto the conveyor once the fusing and shell set up was ready.<br>
• Panel over the conveyor: Panels were made of acrylic sheets to keep on top of the conveyor between railings. This increased the workspace for the operators.<br>
• Angled rack: Two racks were placed back to back at a 120 angle. These racks were divided into 3 color coded columns and 4 rows. Each column was assigned to one operator.<br>
• Job Reengineering: Each operator was assigned to work on specific panels. As they worked on the same panels repeatedly, their efficiency increased.

    <p class="desc2">The knee lining fabric is given a finishing along the selvedge to prevent unravelling. To keep this finish intact, the bottom of the knee lining is not cut, the fabric is laid such that the fabric remains above the line to be cut.<br>
Sometimes the operators would negligently spread the knee lining such that the lower line of the knee lining would be cut on the fabric. This would result in the bottom of the knee lining unraveling. As a result of this, the knee lining would have to be recut.

</p>
    <h2 class="topic2" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Solution<em></em></h2>
    <p class="desc2">After a meeting with the pattern department, the bottom line was deleted from the knee lining pattern. This eliminated the knee lining bottom open problem.
